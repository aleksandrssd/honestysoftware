                                                Changes take place immediately, and can be checked for compliance to ensure that rules for text length and filtered words are followed. This means that users can literally type in new text, upload new pictures, do customization, and then just let the CMS handle how this is placed back on to the website. It is not possible for users to distract the formatting and general look of the website, and means that the content is always as up-to-date as required without effect the current website design.</p>
